## Automation framework with Selenide and Java

In this repository you will learn:
* what is Selenide
* setting up (development) environment
* basic structure of a test automation framework
* how to perform UI testing with Selenide
* UI locators
* gradle

Viewing tutorials and watching videos on test automation can be a way to start, but practice
makes perfect and often what is lacking is a concrete example on how to put everything together.

This sample project uses:
* java
* gradle
* selenide
* junit

Since you've landed on GitHub I will start from the premise that some (basic) knowledge
about version control systems abd the automation ecosystem are known.
