# Test Automation Framework with Java and Selenide

## Overview

This repository shows how to integrate various components into a cohesive framework.

A test automation framework provides a set of guidelines or rules for creating and designing test scripts. It combines
good practices and tools or libraries to assist Test Engineers in developing effective test scripts. These guidelines
typically cover coding standards, test data management, organization of test logic and scenarios, test result
processing, and resource access.

## Technologies Used

* Java
* Selenide
* Gradle
* JUnit
* Log4j
* Jackson

Assuming a basic understanding of programming, version control systems, and the automation ecosystem (including build
management tools, UI testing tools, locators, and CI/CD) will be beneficial.

Detailed documentation about the framework can be found [here](src/main/java/com/automation/doc/description.md).

## Framework Capabilities

* **Environment Flexibility**: Run tests on different instances, such as development or testing environments.
* **Test Execution**: Running the tests is possible using GitHub Actions workflow.
* **Browser Compatibility**: Execute tests on various browsers.
* **Test Suite Management**: Run different groups of tests (test suites) using Gradle tasks.
